# Introduction #

The purpose of this assignment is for the student to implement MiniMax and add that to their AI.

When the student is done with this assignment, the AI will be able to pick the best overall move based on how deep the AI was able to get in the MiniMax tree.


# Requirements #

  * Implement the MiniMax algorithm and add it to your AI.
  * Add the code to make the DecisionTree have all of the information from MiniMax. You should be able to step through all of the decisions your AI is making in the DecisionTree viewer.
  * Be able to play a full game with `RuntAI_MiniMax`
  * Must adhere to time limits
  * Do not use static variables anywhere. Static classes and methods are fine.
