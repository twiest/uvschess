#summary How to get UvsChess, and how to compile it on your computer

= Introduction =

Google Code uses Subversion as its source code control server. You will need a subversion (svn) client in order to get the code. For windows, we recommend TortoiseSVN (http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/).

Once you have an svn client, you should check out the project code from svn. Go to the "Source" tab for instructions on how to check out the project.

This project was built with Visual Studio 2008 C# Express. 
You will also need to install the latest Mono release before you can compile the project.
You can get that from http://www.mono-project.com
