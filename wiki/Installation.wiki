#summary How to get UvsChess, and how to compile it on your computer

= Introduction =

Google Code uses Suversion as it's source code control server. You will need a subersion (svn) client in order to get the code. For windows, we recommend TortoiseSVN (http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/).

You should check out the project from subversion. Go to the "Source" tab for instructions on how to check out the project.

You'll also need to install the latest Mono release before you can compile the project.
You can get that from http://www.mono-project.com


= Details =

For Windows:
After Mono is installed, add the Mono 'bin' directory to the system path. The bin directory path should look similar to "C:\Program Files\Mono-1.2.3.1\bin"
