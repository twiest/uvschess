# Introduction #

The purpose of this assignment is to get the student familiar with the chess AI framework, and to start actually coding the easy parts of the chess AI.

When the student is done with this assignment, the AI will be able to generate valid chess moves, pick one of those moves at random and validate the opponent's moves.


# Requirements #

  * Use the StudentAI project included in the chess AI framework as a starting point for your AI.
  * Name your AI
  * Create a method that takes a chess board and a color and creates all of the possible moves for that color given the chess board.
  * Using the method above, randomly pick a move and return that to the framework.
  * Add the code necessary to show all of the moves generated by your AI in the [DecisionTree](http://code.google.com/p/uvschess/wiki/DecisionTreeHowTo) viewer.
  * Create a method that validates moves passed in by the framework.
  * Be able to play a full game with `RuntAI_Random`
  * Do not use static variables anywhere. Static classes and methods are fine.
